Spring Assignment 1:- Basic SpringMVC WebAPP using Collection for Persistence
Take any usecase as example and build a webapp that performs below functionalities
1. The app should display the resources in a tabular form along with a delete option (use anchor element) for each row
2. The app should provide a form to add a new resource to the database (Arraylist is to be used for storing the resource)
3. The app should delete the corresponsing resource when its delete option is selected
4. The app should update the table view upon each addition and deletion to/from the database.
Notes:-
- Use DispatcherServlet as Front Controller
- Use JSP and JSTL for creating the html content
- Use InternalResourceViewResolver for resolving the view
- Use Java Configurations and use appropriate class/method annotations wherever applicable
